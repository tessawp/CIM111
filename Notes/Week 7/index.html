        <h2>My History</h2>
        I started rowing when I was 16. A lot of people start when they’re 14 but my parents wanted me to finish growing before I started as the physical strain of the sport can lead to injuries if you’re not ready to start yet. I come from a rowing family so I’ve had my eyes on doing the sport myself since I was around 11. Both my parents rowed, as well as my uncle, aunty, both my grandparents (dad’s side), and my two sisters. It’s great to have a family that understands the sport to help me grow and move past issues I may be having whether it be technical, or mentally.
        My ultimate aim is to pursue the elite New Zealand Rowing Team which I hope to get into after I finish my collegiate rowing career.

           <h2>Physical Demands</h2>
           Rowing is a mix of endurance and strength. 70% of the race is spent in an aerobic state, while the remaining 20% is spent in an anaerobic state. Thus, the training must include both aerobic (long, steady state), and anaerobic (short, high intensity).
           Rowers must have strong legs (as most of the stroke is made up of the leg drive), core, and upper back. However, they must have strength in all areas of the body as it is a full body workout, of course, more strong in those areas listed above.

           <h2>The Legacy</h2>

       My dad has a reputable history in Rowing New Zealand. He started rowing in high school and found success there so decided to continue from there, onto elite club rowing. He was selected into the mens eight for Rowing New Zealand in the early 80s. He became one of the top two mens rowers in the country over the course of his elite career. He competed in 5 seat of the NZ mens eight for the first time on the world stage in 1982. They earned themselves a gold medal by a 3 second margin over Germany. Following this success, they competed at the World Champs the following year in 1983. Again, they secured the gold over Germany by just over a second. With a two year winning streak in this event, they were selected to compete at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.
       <br>
       At the time, funding was near obsolete so they had to raise most of the funds themselves in order to go. This was rather difficult considering every member of the crew had day jobs to support their rowing career which had no pay back then.
       <br>
       Finally, they built enough funds to make it to Los Angeles. They made it to the A final, feeling confident given their previous results, however, it was not the same crew that raced in 82’ and 83’. They had replaced two members of the crew and switched the seating around. This made a questionable, dramatic change to the crew. Unfortunately, they came 4th, beat by Australia by less than a second. We will never know if the crew change caused their result to fall short. Although, I’m still immensely proud to say that my dad made it to the Olympics because that’s a feat in and of itself.
