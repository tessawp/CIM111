    <p id="responsive_headline">Kia Ora! (hello) My name is Tessa White-Parsons, I’m from New Zealand, and I am an undergrad here at the University of Miami majoring in Interactive Media. Since coming to the States, I have discovered what truly interests me - art and design. This was a big jump from my original major of Exercise Physiology. I found after almost 2 years of study that it wasn’t the right fit for me.
        <br>
      In my life I’ve tried many things that didn’t seem to fit my persona; the biggest one was modeling. There was once a time where I believed modeling was going to be my career for as long as young, physical appearances were sustained. As I grew older and more mature, modeling didn’t feel like it could be something to be proud of. I was apart of a machine - a mannequin for somebody else’s vision. I wanted to be a creator - share my own vision. That’s when I decided I would use my talents in rowing to acquire a scholarship to study over in the US. It was the best decision I ever made. Before starting this study abroad adventure, I aspired to accomplish more, but I never knew what that might entail. Now, my interests are set in the realm of design, whether it be graphic design, interaction design, or animation. I believe I have a lot to offer in any of those fields.

      <p id="responsive_headline">From a young age, I’ve enjoyed drawing and creating things. It’s always been a calming outlet. Until now, I never imagined using these skills in a career setting.
      Interactive Media has allowed me to discover that my artistic abilities lend a good eye to design. Capabilities of creating appealing composition translates well in designing a webpage or application that makes sense to the user.
      My priorities in art and design is always to execute simplicity at a finer level. Producing work that I can be proud of gives me a sense of satisfaction that keeps me wanting more.

      <p id="responsive_headline">For various reasons, rowing has changed my life. They say that rowing is one of the most physiologically demanding sports out there. It is because of this high physical demand that it requires strong-willed individuals. Among other things, you must be adaptable. In this ultimate team sport, you spend a lot of time switching between crews to find the best combination. Rowers must also be fearless. Going as hard as you can down a 2km course is always daunting, but you have to be willing to give it everything and trust that the rest of the crew is doing the same.
      <br>
      These traits are few among many in what it takes to be a successful rower. These traits being very applicable in not just design, but any workforce. I believe that my time in this sport has equipped me for success in many different factors in life.
