      <h3><u>Personal Summary</u></h3>
       <p>Athletics has defined most of my life. Before I pursued an athletic career in the states, I worked for a high fashion modeling agency, IMG.
          <br>
         Eventually I found that lifestyle unpalatable and pursued my passion for Rowing whilst working in retail for a clothing company.
          <br>
         I then found myself here at UM on full athlete scholarship.
